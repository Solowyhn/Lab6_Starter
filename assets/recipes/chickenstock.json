This is the only chicken stock recipe you&#39;ll ever need. It&#39;s an excellent all-rounder that can be used for everything from clear soups to rich stews, gravies and creamy sauces. The key is to use chicken frames (carcass) which yields the ideal balance of flavour, nutrients and richness. They are inexpensive and even available at grocery stores these days.No rinsing or roasting prep like call for beef stock, just plonk everything in a pot and let it simmer for a few hours!Makes 2 litres / 2 quarts. Fridge 5 days or freezer for 6 months.","datePublished":"2021-09-20T14:47:05+00:00","image":["https://www.recipetineats.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Homemade-chicken-stock_92-SQ.jpg","https://www.recipetineats.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Homemade-chicken-stock_92-SQ.jpg?w=500&h=500&crop=1","https://www.recipetineats.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Homemade-chicken-stock_92-SQ.jpg?w=500&h=375&crop=1","https://www.recipetineats.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Homemade-chicken-stock_92-SQ.jpg?w=480&h=270&crop=1"],"recipeYield":["2","2 litres / quarts"],"prepTime":"PT15M","cookTime":"PT180M","totalTime":"PT195M","recipeIngredient":["2 kg/ 4 lb  chicken frames (ie carcass) (, raw (Note 1))","1  carrot ((medium), unpeeled, cut into 4 equal pieces)","1/2  onion (, peeled and halved)","1  celery stem (, cut in four (use the leaves too))","1/2 tbsp black peppercorns","1 tbsp apple cider vinegar ((Note 2))","2  bay leaves (, fresh (or 1 dried))","2  thyme sprigs ((or 1/2 tsp dried leaves))","3  parsley sprigs","3 litres / 3 quarts  water ((just tap water, cold))"],"recipeInstructions":[{"@type":"HowToSection","name":"How to make chicken stock:","itemListElement":[{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"Fill pot: Place all the chicken stock ingredients into a large stockpot (7 litre / 7 quarts+).
